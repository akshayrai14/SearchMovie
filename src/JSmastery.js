//All the things i have learnt in this course of 1 hour from JSmastery

 //Virtual DOM in React js makes it way faster because it changes only that part of a page which is edited and not the entire page 

 //making any web page means splitting it into many components and then if needed splitting the components into further components

 //inside of {} any valid javascript expression can be written which helps to dynamically render real data in HTML

 //we want to write javascript inside of HTML then {} and inside of that we again want to render things then fragment is used <></> to used more than one elements of HTML
